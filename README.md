# Spotify Covergrabber

The script will ask for the track/album link when running. Copy and paste using spotify's ``Share --> Copy Song/Album Link`` feature.

To install, move the script into the ``/usr/local/bin`` folder. This will require sudo permission.

If you want to use it as a normal python program, simply add the ``.py`` extension and remove the first line.

Have fun! ;-)
